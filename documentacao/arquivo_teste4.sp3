/3 This program allows you to find out
/3 your age by "inputting" the year that
/3 you were born in

/3 year that we're in
num cur = 2021;

/3 year that a person was born
num yar = 1994;

num age = cur - yar;

str out  = "";
/3 now we're gonna judge whether a person is old or not
ifi (age < 20 ) {
    str out = "How do you do fellow kid?";
} els {
    ifi (age < 41) {
      str out = "Life is young, at least for you";
      } els {
        str out = "Ok boomer";
      }
}
